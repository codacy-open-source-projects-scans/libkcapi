Kernel Patches
==============

The following kernel patches are provided in this directory:

* `asym` contains the patches to integrate algif_akcipher.c for making
the asymmetric ciphers available to user space. These patches are needed
for when using the --enable-lib-asym configure option and the
kcapi_akcipher_* API functions.

* `kpp` contains the patches for making the KPP kernel crypto API
available to user space. This API offers DH and ECDH. The patches are
required when using the --enable-lib-kpp configure option and the
kcapi_kpp_* API calls.

Note, the `kpp` patches go on top of the `asym` patches.

WARNING: THESE PATCHES CONTAIN ERRORS ALLOWING USERS TO DoS THE KERNEL.
THESE ERRORS ARE FIXED WITH THE 4.15 PATCHES.
